# Clue hi
Run ./create to create the sixteen users and change permissions so only each user can access their own directory

Run ./del to delete all of the users and refresh back to normal

## If it's not running, do the following:

If you want to create it
> chmod 777 create

> ./create

If you want to delete it
> chmod 777 del

> ./del

Make sure you're doing these operations in the same directory as the files downloaded
